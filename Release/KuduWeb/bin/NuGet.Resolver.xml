            <summary>
            This class is responsible for finding the best combination of compatible items. The caller
            supplies a collection of groups, a sorting function (to determine priority within a group), and
            a function to determine whether two items are incompatible. The solution (if found) will contain 
            exactly 1 item from each group.

            <summary>
            The initial domains are the full/initial candidate sets we start with when 
            attempting to discover a solution. They need to be stored and referred to
            as the algorithm executes to re-initialize the current/working domains.

        <member name="F:NuGet.Resolver.CombinationSolver`1.currentDomains">
            <summary>
            The current domains are initialized with the initial domains. As we progress
            through the algorithm, we may remove elements from the current domain as we
            discover that an item cannot be part of the solution. If we need to backtrack,
            we may reset the current domain to the corresponding initial domain.

            For each position, maintain a Stack of sets of items that were 'reduced' from the domain. This allows us
            to restore the items back into the domain on future iterations in case we need to back up, etc...

            <summary>
            Entry point for the combination evalutation phase of the algorithm. The algorithm
            combines forward checking [FC] (i.e. trying to eliminate future possible combinations to evaluate)
            with Conflict-directed Back Jumping.
            
            Based off the FC-CBJ algorithm described in Prosser's Hybrid
            Algorithms for the Constraint Satisfaction Problem: http://archive.nyu.edu/bitstream/2451/14410/1/IS-90-10.pdf
